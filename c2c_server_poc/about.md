Technical Description: SIP Covert Channel Proof-of-Concept Server
This Python implementation demonstrates a proof-of-concept covert channel server that exploits SIP protocol flexibility for command extraction and execution. The code serves as the receiving component in a covert communication test scenario.
Architecture and Components:
The SIPCovertC2Server class implements a UDP-based listener on port 5060 (standard SIP) that processes incoming SIP messages to extract encoded commands from protocol headers. The server operates through several key functional modules:
1. Message Reception and Processing
a)	Binds to UDP socket and processes SIP traffic asynchronously using threading
b)	Parses incoming SIP messages to extract header fields
c)	Maintains operational statistics (messages received, commands detected, execution status)
2. Covert Data Extraction 
The system implements multiple extraction methods targeting different SIP headers:
a)	Custom X-Headers: Searches for non-standard headers (X-Custom-Data, X-Session-ID, X-Call-Info, X-Covert-Channel) containing base64-encoded payloads
b)	User-Agent Field: Extracts data embedded in version strings or build parameters using regex patterns
c)	Contact Header: Parses URI parameters (data=, cmd=, info=) for encoded content
d)	Via Header Branch: Analyzes branch parameters exceeding typical length (>16 characters) for embedded data
3. Command Execution
a)	Implements a whitelist-based execution model restricting commands to safe system information queries (whoami, pwd, hostname, etc.)
b)	Uses subprocess isolation with 10-second timeout constraints
c)	Logs all execution attempts with timestamps and source identification
4. Protocol Compliance
a)	Generates RFC-compliant SIP responses (200 OK, 404 Not Found) to maintain protocol legitimacy
b)	Includes proper Via, From, To, Call-ID, and CSeq headers in responses
c)	Responds to maintain normal traffic appearance
5. Forensic Logging
a)	Records all covert channel detections to JSON format (/tmp/sip_covert_incidents.json)
b)	Captures metadata: timestamp, source IP/port, command content, header type used
c)	Maintains session statistics for analysis
Research Application:
This implementation was used to generate test traffic for validation of the detection framework developed in this research. It demonstrates how SIP protocol flexibility can be exploited while maintaining protocol compliance, thereby evading traditional security monitoring that focuses on application-layer content rather than header-level anomalies.
The proof-of-concept validates the threat model and provides realistic attack patterns for training machine learning detection models (TC-05, TC-06) and evaluating detection accuracy against known covert channel techniques.
